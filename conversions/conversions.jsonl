A validated quality assessment tool for prevalence studies was\n \nused to evaluate the risk of bias5. In a summary table, we copied the following information:\n \nauthor and year, region, age range, sample size, diagnostic domain, condition or construct,\n \ninstrument, informants, prevalence and SD or CI 95%, mean score and SD.\n \n    We aggregated the extracted information into a synthesis table containing the following\n \ninformation for each mental condition: regions, number of studies, total number of\n \nparticipants, assessment instruments, informants, lowest prevalence reported, and highest\n \nprevalence reported. This table only concerned mental health conditions and did not\n \ninclude information on quality of life and relatable constructs of mental well-being.\n        \n2.7.2) Instrument studies\n2.7.2) Instrument studies\n    The Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments\n \n(COSMIN) guidelines were followed to extract data and to evaluate the methodological\n \nquality of findings.\n6\n If the manual did not include an important aspect of data extraction, we\n \nconsulted literature on the area to adapt an extraction strategy.\nIn a data sheet, the following information was extracted from the studies: first author, year\n \nof publication, name of the instrument, diagnostic domain, construct evaluated, original\n \nlanguage, target population, informer/rater, recall period, number of items, response\n \noptions, estimated time of application, sample size, age mean/range, percentage of\n \nfemales, diagnosed conditions, setting, response rate, proposed cut-off, percentage of\n \nmissing items, floor and ceiling effects. In the same data sheet, we extracted information\n \non sampling and psychometric properties. In a multi-choice field we marked the procedures\n \nof the study (\u201cdevelops an instrument\u201d, \u201ctranslates an instrument\u201d, \u201cvalidates an\n \ninstrument\u201d, \u201ctranslates and validates an instrument\u201d, \u201csolely applies an instrument\u201d; this is\n \n6\nCitation:\nCitation:\n lauromarchionatti, Anastasia Koumoula, Arthur Caye, Vasiliki Eirini Karagiorga, Julia Luiza Schafer, Giovanni Abrah\u00c3\u200b\u00c2\u00a3o\nSalum J\u00c3\u200b\u00c2\u00banior \nProtocol for a nationwide systematic review of the Greek literature on child and adolescent mental health\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.n92ldzo3nv5b/v1\n \nThis is an open access protocol distributed under the terms of the \nCreative Commons Attribution License\nCreative Commons Attribution License\n(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,\nprovided the original author and source are creditednot contemplated in the COSMIN manual and was included for organizing purposes). If the\n \nstudy contained information on instrument translation, we marked whether it contemplated\n \na back-and-forth translation procedure (this procedure is also not contemplated in COSMIN,\n \nas the manual does not concern instrument translation). For studies reporting instrument\n \ndevelopment, we marked the methodological quality of the items \u201cdevelopment quality\u201d\n \nand \u201ccontent validity quality\u201d according to the following categories: very good, adequate,\n \ndoubtful, inadequate, or not applicable. For psychometric validation procedures (structural\n \nvalidity, internal consistency, cross-cultural validity, interrater reliability, test-retest\n \nreliability, measurement error, criterion validity, construct validity, or responsiveness), we\n \nextracted the sample size for each validation, the methodological quality (according to the\n \naforementioned categories), and the results of the validation. This last field contained\n \nspecific information according to each psychometric property: for structural analysis, the\n \nkind of analysis, how many factors explained how much of the variance, and resulting\n \nstatistics. For internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha or corresponding measures. For\n \ncross-cultural validity, the results of multi-group confirmatory factor analysis with\n \nmeasurement invariance evaluation. For inter-rater reliability and for test-retest reliability,\n \nstatistics such as intraclass correlation coefficient, pearson or spearman correlation, or\n \nkappa score. For measurement error, the patient\u2019s score error statistics. For criterion\n \nvalidity, the statistics of the performance of the instrument against a gold standard. For\n \nconstruct validity, the correlation coefficients with other instruments. For responsiveness, if\n \nthe instrument detected statistically significant differences over time.\n    In a summary table, we presented information of the psychometric properties of each\n \ninstrument in each study according to a coding provided in COSMIN: \u201c+\u201d, for sufficient; \u201c-\u201d,\n \nfor insufficient; and \u201c?\u201d, for indeterminate. The criteria were adapted for instrument\n \ntranslation/development (as it is not contemplated in COSMIN) and for responsiveness\n \n(the COSMIN used the area under the curve as the parameter for the coding, but this\n \nstatistic was not available in any of the studies we included; for this reason, we rated as\n \nsufficient evidence of responsiveness whenever an instrument detected statistically\n \nsignificant differences in clinical trials, rating as indeterminate when differences were not\n \nfound).

The proteins may be separated by charge and/or size (isoelectric\n \nfocusing agarose electrophoresis is essentially size independent), and the DNA and\n \nRNA fragments by length. Biomolecules are separated by applying an electric field to\n \nmove the charged molecules through an agarose matrix, and the biomolecules are\n \nseparated by size in the agarose gel matrix.\nAn Agarose gel is easy to cast, has relatively fewer charged groups, and is particularly\n \nsuitable for separating DNA of size range most often encountered in laboratories,\n \nwhich accounts for the popularity of its use. The separated DNA may be viewed with\n \nstain, most commonly under UV light, and the DNA fragments can be extracted from\n \nthe gel with relative ease.

The molecules are separated by applying an electric field to move the charged molecules through an agarose matrix, with separation primarily based on size.\n\nRoutinely, agarose gels are suitable for separating DNA of various size ranges, can be stained and visualized under UV light, and DNA fragments can be extracted from the gel easily.\n\n## Reagents\n\n- 1 x DI Water\n- 1 x bottle of TAE (or TBE)\n- 1 x bottle of Agarose Powder\n- 1 x bottle of SYBR Safe\n- 1 x bottle of 6x Loading Dye\n\n## Supplies\n\n- Green temporary seal(s)\n- Foil seal(s)\n\n## Equipment\n\n- 10\u00b5L pipette, tip box, & tips\n- 20\u00b5L pipette, tip box, & tips\n- 200uL pipette, tip box, & tips\n- 1000uL pipette, tip box, & tips\n- Serological pipette & 10mL tip\n\n### Note on SYBR\u2122 Safe Dye:\nSYBR\u2122 Safe DNA gel stain showed no or very low mutagenic activity in tests and is not classified as hazardous waste under U.S. Federal regulations. However, standard care should be taken when handling and disposing of this reagent in compliance with all local regulations.\n\n#### Storage:\nSYBR\u2122 Safe DNA gel stain can be stored between 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C. SYBR\u2122 Safe in DMSO freezes at low temperatures; it must be completely thawed and mixed before use.\n\n## Procedure\n\n### Pouring a Standard 2% Agarose Gel (21 min)\n\n1. **Measure 1g of Agarose.**\n\n2. **Prepare Agarose Solution:**\n   - Mix agarose powder with **49mL of DI water and 1mL of 50x TAE** in a microwavable flask.\n\n3. **Dissolve Agarose:**\n   - Microwave for **1-3 minutes** until the agarose is completely dissolved.\n     > **Note:** Do not overboil to avoid buffer evaporation which alters gel percentage. Prefer pulse microwaving to avoid boiling.\n\n4. **Cool Agarose Solution:**\n   - Let the solution cool down to **about 50\u00b0C for about 5 minutes**.\n\n5. **(Optional) Stain Agarose:**\n   - Add **5uL of SYBR Safe** to the flask.\n     > **Note:** SYBR Safe binds to DNA, allowing visualization under UV light. If using EtBr, handle it with caution as it's a mutagen.\n\n6. **Pour Gel:**\n   - Pour the agarose into a gel tray with well comb in place.\n\n7. **Solidify Gel:**\n   - Place newly poured gel at **4\u00b0C for 15 minutes** or let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes until completely solidified.\n     > **Note:** Pour slowly to avoid disrupting bubbles. Use a pipette tip to push the bubbles away if they form.\n\n### Loading Samples and Running an Agarose Gel (21 min)\n\n8. **Add Loading Buffer to Samples:**\n   - Prepare ladder dilution: **Molecular Grade Water + 10uL of 1kb Ladder**.\n   - Mix at least **10uL of ladder or sample with 2uL of 6x Loading Dye** for a total volume of 12uL.\n     > For lower DNA concentrations, mix **15uL of ladder or sample with 2.5uL of 6x Loading Dye.**\n\n9. **Place Gel in Box:**\n   - Once solidified, place the agarose gel into the gel box (electrophoresis unit).\n\n10. **Add Running Buffer:**\n    - Fill the gel box with **1x TAE** (or TBE) until the gel is covered.\n\n11. **Load Ladder:**\n    - Carefully load a molecular weight ladder into the first lane of the gel.\n\n12. **Load Samples:**\n    - Carefully load your samples into the additional wells of the gel.\n\n13. **Run Gel:**\n    - Run the gel at **80-150V** until the dye line is approximately **75-80% of the way down the gel**.\n      > Typical run time is about 1-1.5 hours, depending on gel concentration and voltage.\n      > **Note:** Always run to RED (positive electrode).\n\n### Analyzing Your Gel (21 min)\n\n14. **Stop Run:**\n    - Turn OFF power, disconnect electrodes, and carefully remove the gel from the box.\n      > If EtBR was used, place the gel into running buffer and destain.\n\n15. **Visualize Gel:**\n    - Visualize DNA fragments using a UV light device.\n      > **Note:** For longer storage or less damage, use long-wavelength UV and minimize exposure time.\n\n**Caution:** When using UV light, protect your hands and eyes by wearing appropriate PPE (Personal Protective Equipment).\n\n---\n\n**End of Output**\n```\n"}]}

Reguero,David N. Bresch\nAbstract\nAs climate change progresses, so does the risk from hurricanes, \ufb02ooding, and other natural\ndisasters.  As sea level rises, tropical cyclones will pose a greater risk of extreme \ufb02ooding and\nare likely to in\ufb02ict the greatest damages on highly populated shorelines. A catastrophic\nhurricane season in the Caribbean during 2017 is exempli\ufb01es how these events can strained\ngovernment budgets and impact coastal communities. Globally, it is projected that coastal\ngrowth in population and development will outpace progress in risk reduction. The need to\nupgrade existing \ufb02ood protection and to plan for future coastal risks is becoming increasingly\napparent. However, e\ufb00ective adaptation requires understanding the di\ufb00erent drivers of risk from\nan economic perspective, including coastal development and the impacts of climate change.\nThere is a need for better strategic visions for risk reduction and climate adaptation that involves\nspeci\ufb01c science and quanti\ufb01cation to address stakeholder concerns and supports climate change\npolicy. Analyses should be able to: (i) identify areas most at risk, (ii) quantify losses and\ndamages under various present and future scenarios, and (iii) compare and prioritize potential\nsolutions with cost-bene\ufb01t analysis. This protocol describes a quantitative risk assessment\nframework to assess coastal \ufb02ood risk (factoring both climate change and economic exposure\ngrowth) and to compare the cost e\ufb00ectiveness of di\ufb00erent adaptation measures. These\nadaptation options may include nature-based (e.g. oyster reef restoration), structural or grey\ninfrastructure (e.g., seawalls) and policy measures (e.g. home elevation or coastal development\npolicies).\nCitation:  Borja G.

For more information, consult:\nhttp://www.swissre.com/eca/\nBefore start\nRisk occurs at the intersection of economic assets and the hazard of coastal \ufb02ooding. Adaptation can\nhave an e\ufb00ect of each component of risk. There are three distinctive parts to assess the cost\ne\ufb00ectinves of adaptation measures:\n \n1)    Assessing Current Risk\nRisk is quanti\ufb01ed as a loss associated with a certain probability. The event loss or damage is the sum\nof all individual losses resulting from a single occurrence of a natural hazard (e.g. \ufb02oods). Each\nindividual loss is quanti\ufb01ed from three terms:\nHazard  (or \u2018peril\u2019): de\ufb01ned by the location, frequency and intensity of events (storm \ufb02ooding),\ni.e. where, how often and with what intensity do storms occur?\nAssets exposed : de\ufb01ned by the location and value of the distinct types of buildings and\nassets.\nDamages to assets : is the relationship between the extent of damage and the event intensity,\nde\ufb01ned by damage (or vulnerability) curves. \n2)    Assessing Future Risk\nFuture risk derives from both changes in climate and in economic exposure. The e\ufb00ects of climate\nchange on the hazards should consider all the factors a\ufb00ecting \ufb02ooding in coastal zones: land\nsubsidence, sea level rise and changes in intensity and frequency of storms.\nAdditionally, future risk should also factor in changes in coastal exposure as this factor is particularly\nacute in the coastal areas due to the intense development that occur in coastal zones.\n \n3)    Assessing the Economics of Adaptation measures\nAssessing the cost (i.e. construction and maintenance) and bene\ufb01ts (i.e. losses averted) of adaptation\nrequires assessing the potential damage averted from each adaptation measure. This is done in a\nsequence of steps:\nDe\ufb01ne certain adaptation strategies that are composed by adaptation measures that have an1.\ne\ufb00ect on hazard attenuation or on coastal exposure. \nEstimate the bene\ufb01t of each measure: each measure at speci\ufb01c locations is assumed to protect2.\na percentage of property for a certain period of time (for which the bene\ufb01t is calculated).\nCalculate the cost of each measure: includes the cost of construction (depends on dimensions3.3 Published:  10 Jan 2018\nThis is an open access protocol distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License , which permits unrestricted use, distribution,\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are creditedof the measure and unitary costs) and the cost of regular maintenance, as well as any other\ntype of cost during its lifetime.  \nCalculate Net Present Value (NPV) of costs and bene\ufb01ts: the di\ufb00erence between the present4.\nvalue of cash in\ufb02ows (bene\ufb01ts from adaptation) and the present value of cash out\ufb02ows (cost\nand maintenance throughout the implementation period). NPV is calculated as follows:\nCalculate baseline risk (today) with and without the measure: calculate annual expected1.\ndamage with no measures and with the e\ufb00ect of the measures applied; the di\ufb00erence is\nthe bene\ufb01t of implementing the measure today.\nCalculate future risk (e.g. in year 2050): using future assets and expose future hazards,2.\ncalculate annual expected damage with no measures and with the measures applied; the\ndi\ufb00erence represents the future bene\ufb01t of the measure.\nDiscount the bene\ufb01t to present terms: discounting bene\ufb01ts for a total of T years, its NPV3.\nwill be: , where i is the discounting rate, used in economic analysis to consider\nproductivity of capital and the preferences of the population. \nDiscount the cost to present terms: as for bene\ufb01ts.4.\nCalculate the  bene\ufb01t to cost ratio  for each measure. Costs estimates for each adaptation 5.\nmeasures should consider construction, maintenance and other derived costs.

This involves identifying areas at risk, quantifying losses and damages under various scenarios, and comparing potential adaptation solutions using cost-benefit analysis.\n\n# Assessing Coastal Risk and the Economics of Climate Adaptation\n\n**Authors:** Borja G. Reguero, David N. Bresch\n\n**Citation:** Borja G. Reguero, David N. Bresch Assessing Coastal Risk and the Economics of Climate Adaptation. protocols.io dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.miyc4fw\n\n**Published:** 10 Jan 2018\n\n## Abstract\n\nAs climate change progresses, so does the risk from hurricanes, flooding, and other natural disasters. As sea levels rise, tropical cyclones will pose a greater risk of extreme flooding and are likely to inflict the greatest damages on highly populated shorelines. This protocol describes a quantitative risk assessment framework to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different adaptation measures. These options may include natural solutions (e.g., oyster reef restoration), structural solutions (e.g., seawalls), and policy measures (e.g., home elevation or coastal development policies).\n\n## Guidelines\n\nThe protocol is part of the \u2018Economics of Climate Adaptation\u2019 framework and is implemented in climada, particularly the \u2018coastal module\u2019.\n\nFor more information, consult: [www.swissre.com/eca/](http://www.swissre.com/eca/)\n\n## Before Start\n\nRisk occurs at the intersection of economic assets and the hazard of coastal flooding. Adaptation can impact each risk component. There are three parts to assess the cost-effectiveness of adaptation measures:\n\n### 1. Assessing Current Risk\n\nRisk is quantified as a probable loss. The total loss from a natural hazard (e.g., floods) is a combination of three factors:\n\n- **Hazard (or 'peril')**: Defined by the location, frequency, and intensity of events.\n- **Assets exposed**: Defined by the location and value of buildings and assets.\n- **Damages to assets**: The relationship between the extent of damage and event intensity, determined by damage (or vulnerability) curves.\n\n### 2. Assessing Future Risk\n\nFuture risk arises from climate and economic changes. Factors include land subsidence, sea level rise, and changes in storm patterns. Coastal exposure changes, due to development intensification, also contribute to future risk.\n\n### 3. Assessing the Economics of Adaptation Measures\n\nThe cost and benefits (losses averted) of adaptation measures are assessed by:\n\n1. Defining adaptation strategies.\n2. Estimating the benefits of each measure in protecting a percentage of property.\n3. Calculating the cost of each measure.\n4. Calculating the Net Present Value (NPV) of costs and benefits, calculated as follows:\n   - Calculate both baseline risk (current) and future risk (e.g., 2050).\n   - Discount benefits and costs to present terms.\n5. Calculating the benefit-to-cost ratio.\n\nCost estimates for each adaptation measure can be derived from the review of past projects or local estimates.\n\n## Protocol\n\n### Assessment of Coastal Flooding\n\n**Step 1.** \n- Historical and synthetic storms are simulated with climada.\n- Total water levels are calculated based on surges, tides, sea level rise, and wave runup.\n\n**Software Package (Matlab):** [CLIMADA - COASTAL, 1.0](https://github.com/borjagreguero/climada_coastal_hazards_module)\n**Dataset:** [Sea Level Rise NOAA measurements](#)\n\n### Assessment of Coastal Exposure\n\n**Step 2.**\n- In GIS, data on building value is calculated for each ground height.\n- Flood maps are created using a bathtub approach for each ground height.\n\n**Dataset:** [Elevation model](#)\n\n### Calculation of Damages\n\n**Step 3.**\n- Damages are calculated in climada, considering asset distribution for each ground height.\n\n**Software Package (Matlab):** [CLIMADA - COASTAL, 1.0](https://github.com/borjagreguero/climada_coastal_hazards_module)\n\n### Calculation of Cost and Benefits\n\n**Step 4.**\na) Estimate adaptation strategies for hazard attenuation, location, cost, and protection percentage.\n\nb) Calculate net present value over the period the adaptation measure is designed for.\n\n**Software Package (Matlab):** [CLIMADA - COASTAL, 1.0](https://github.com/borjagreguero/climada_coastal_hazards_module)\n\n---\n\nendofoutput\n```"}]}
