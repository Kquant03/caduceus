# Goal/Experiment:
The goal of this experiment is to conduct a nationwide systematic review of the Greek literature on child and adolescent mental health. This includes mapping available resources, tracing research priorities, and categorizing data on prevalence surveys, assessment instruments, and interventions for mental health conditions among children and adolescents in Greece.

## Introduction
This is a landscape analysis of scientific literature to map available resources and trace research priorities on child and adolescent mental health in Greece. We describe a nation-wide systematic review of prevalence surveys, assessment instruments, and interventions for mental health conditions among children and adolescents within the country.

## Methods

### 2.1 Guidelines
We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement.

### 2.2 Protocol Registration
This study is being registered after initiation of data extraction. The extraction tables were expected to require adaptations due to the broad scope. The best strategies for data synthesis could not be a priori set, thus the protocol is registered post-extraction.

### 2.3 Search Strategy
A comprehensive, multi-step search procedure from inception to December 16th, 2021, without language restrictions:

1. **Databases:** 
    - Medline (via PubMed)
    - Web of Science
    - PsycINFO

   Using the following query:
   
   ```plaintext
   BLOCK A: children and adolescents
   ((((((((((((((adolesc*[Title]) OR preadolesc*[Title]) OR pre-adolesc*[Title]) OR child*[Title]) OR boy*[Title]) OR girl*[Title]) OR infant*[Title]) OR juvenil*[Title]) OR minors[Title]) OR paediatr*[Title]) OR pediatr*[Title]) OR pubescen*[Title]) OR puberty[Title]) OR school*[Title]) OR student*[Title]) OR teen*[Title]) OR young[Title]) OR youth*[Title]) OR class*[Title]) OR orphan*[Title]) OR high-school*[Title]) OR "high school"[Title]) OR preschool*[Title]) OR pre-school*[Title])

   + BLOCK B: Greece
   (''Greece'' OR ''Greek'')

   + BLOCK C: Mental health
   "Mental disorders"[Mesh terms] OR Autism OR Enuresis OR Encopresis OR ADHD OR "Intellectual disability" OR "Mental retardation" OR "Oppositional Defiant Disorder" OR "Conduct Disorder" OR Depression OR "Bipolar" OR "Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder" OR Suicide OR Suicidality OR "Self-harm" OR "Obsessive-compulsive disorder" OR Trauma OR PTSD OR Mutism OR "Substance abuse" OR "Cannabis" OR Alcohol OR "Drug abuse" OR "Anorexia" OR "Bulimia" OR "Eating disorder" OR "Borderline" OR "Personality disorder" OR Schizophrenia OR "Psychosis" OR "Mental health" OR "Quality of life" OR "Well-being"
   ```

2. **IATAPOTEK Database** 
   Using corresponding Greek terms for local literature.

3. **Google Scholar Database** 
   Using English and Greek terms to reach gray literature and to scan for new inclusions. Independently inspected by two authors till 100 novel studies are found.

4. **Reference List of Studies**
   For snowballing inclusion.

5. **Local Experts**
   For additional references.

### 2.4 Review Scope
After retrieving a set of studies, they were screened and sorted into the following research areas:
- Prevalence estimates
- Assessment instruments
- Interventions

### 2.5 Inclusion Criteria

#### 2.5.1 Prevalence Studies
Inclusion Criteria:
- Surveys on community-based, school-based, or other representative samples focusing on children and adolescents in Greece.
- Studies assessing the prevalence of mental health conditions or symptoms, or quality of life using standard procedures or validated instruments.

Exclusion Criteria:
- Clinical or non-representative samples (e.g., specific patient groups)
- Conference abstracts

#### 2.5.2 Instrument Studies
Inclusion Criteria:
- Studies reporting instruments for screening, clinical assessment, or diagnosis related to child and adolescent mental health.
- Studies developing, translating, validating, or applying these instruments in Greece.

Exclusion Criteria:
- Instruments not relevant to mental health
- Conference abstracts

#### 2.5.3 Intervention Studies
Inclusion Criteria:
- Studies reporting interventions for mental health conditions or mental health promotion targeting children and adolescents in Greece.
- Experimental designs including randomized clinical trials or studies translating/adapting interventions.

Exclusion Criteria:
- Conference abstracts

### 2.6 Screening Process
- **Primary Screening:** 
  - English terms: two authors independently assess results.
  - Greek terms: one native speaker author assesses studies.
  
- **Secondary Screening:** 
  - Single reviewer assesses full-text articles. 
  - Doubts are discussed within the research team.
  - Cross-group inclusions are possible during secondary screening.

### 2.7 Data Extraction and Synthesis

#### 2.7.1 Prevalence Studies
Data extracted includes:
- First author, year of publication, study description, region, data collection year, sampling details, age range, gender breakdown, screening and diagnostic sample procedures, diagnostic domain, and prevalence estimates (SD or CI).

A synthesis table aggregates extracted data, showing regions, number of studies, participants, instruments, informants, lowest/highest prevalence reported.

#### 2.7.2 Instrument Studies
Using COSMIN guidelines, data extracted includes:
- First author, year of publication, instrument name, diagnostic domain, construct, language, population, and psychometric properties.

A synthesis table aggregates details about instruments, studies, psychometric properties, and sufficiency ratings.

#### Coding Criteria:
- "+" for sufficient
- "-" for insufficient
- "?" for indeterminate

Tables summarize criteria for coding.

#### 2.7.3 Intervention Studies
Data extracted per Cochrane manual:
- First author, year of publication, sample size, intervention details, outcomes, and methodological design.

Methodological quality is ascertained using Cochrane risk-of-bias tools for randomized designs, and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for non-randomized designs.

### Summary and Extraction Tables:
A summary table details the above data points for easier reference and understanding.
