ABSTRACT
Fetal Bovine Serum contains traces of ligands of the BMP pathway which affect the flow
 
experiments with the ibidi perfusion system.
replacing EGM2 with 2% with EGM2 with 0.1% BSA 4h prior to onset of flow (with same media)
 
allows cells to respond better and collectively to flow.
BSA 0.1% media prep

50 mL
 EGM2 without FBS
667 µL
 BSA 7.5% solution
filtrate through 0.22um yellow filter.
Add to slides 4h before starting flow.

adding BMP9/10 to flow experiment
in order to obtain a final 
0.5 ng/ml
 , add 1.4ul BMP9/10 of 
10 ug/ml
 initial concentration per
 
perfusion unit (volume of 14ml)
add this to each perfusion unit during slide connection
